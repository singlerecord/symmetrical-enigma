# singlerecord.org

## Your single data store.
singlerecord is the last link in the data security challenge
it solves security, by making you part of the equation
it solves accountability, by making singlerecord developers responsible
for mistakes
it solves spam: you no longer share your most important pieces of data;
you share single use pointers to that data
it solves the worst case scenario for data updates:
say you and your friend change your phone on the same day,
you both no longer have access to the previous phone, so from your new
phone you both send a message to your top 10 contacts saying "this is
<you>, this is my new number"
you never get your friend's message, nor he gets yours
three months pass
you both feel as if the other is ignoring each other's text, but
choose not to call because he or she might be busy
six months pass
you finally see each other at a gathering of friends
he/she calls you out on your ignorance of his texts
you accuse him/her of the same
you both realize you changed numbers 6 months back
3 months of passive friendship wasted
