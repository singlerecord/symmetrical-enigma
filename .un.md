a record is a set of datum implicitly unordered so another data type must be implemented,
something like 'scheme' which is an ordered data set, which finally connect a data-request with
a client who is interested in providing it

===
still to do:
- [ ] send contact request
- [ ] classes
-- [ ] datum
-- [ ] record
-- [ ] dataset
-- [ ] notification_set

encrypt_decrypt.php shows that only 12 cipher methods are able to decrypt the message
this probably means that the other methods require a more detailed approach

user cases:
1. data brokerage
- [user] creates account at [company].com
- [company].com requests to know [user] information
- [user] provides information linking to his *singlerecord* account
- [company] stores *singlerecord* information
- whenever [company] requires [user]'s information, a request is sent to *singlerecord* and is either approved or denied by the [user]

2. automatic contact update
- [user] keeps list of trusted contacts
- [user] keeps list of data items
- each data item has a list of need-to-know contacts when that data item is updated
- [user] updates data, need-to-know contacts get automatic message

singlerecord is the last link in the data security challenge
it solves security, by making you (the end user) an active part of the equation
it solves accountability, by making singlerecord developers responsible
for mistakes and making 3rd party developers who use singlerecord API responsible
for adhering to the singlerecord general terms of services as well as the TOS
that every user designs for his or her data needs
it solves spam: you no longer share your most important pieces of data;
you share single use pointers (think burner phones) to that data
it solves the worst case scenario for data updates:
say you and your friend change your phone on the same day,
you both no longer have access to the previous phone, so from your new 
phone you both send a message to your top 10 contacts saying "this is
<you>, this is my new number"
you never get your friend's message, nor he gets yours
three months pass
you both feel as if the other is ignoring each other's text, but 
choose not to call because he or she might be busy
six months pass
you finally see each other at a gathering of friends
he/she calls you out on your ignorance of his texts
you accuse him/her of the same
you both realize you changed numbers 6 months back
3 months of passive friendship wasted
